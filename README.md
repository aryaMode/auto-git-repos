# auto-git-repos

Hey, this Python program creates a remote repository in GitHub and uploads your local directory to that repo.

## How to use it
1. Generate an [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and copy it.
2. Paste that token after the `token =` in the `config.ini` file.
3. Run the `main.py` file in the directory of which you want to create a repository.
4. Select the folder or all the folders that you want to create a repo of.
